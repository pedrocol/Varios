The whole point of this first step is to be able to write an explanation of what are we going to do?

Denmark Strait Overflow

- Search information on finite difference method, advection equation (Short and fast introduction to modeling. Interest and definition. Space and time discretizations. Model of the advection equation.)
- Dickson and Brown: Bottom flow water, 27.8 isopycnal, observations
- Girton 2003: Hydrographic sections
- Hoyer 2001: Overflow from the space

We will have to answer some questions:
1) What is an overflow?
2) Where can we found them?
3) Why are they important?
